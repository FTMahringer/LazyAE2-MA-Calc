# LazyAE2-MA-Calc

I wrote this small programm to calculate the mutliblock machine parts i need to the 
[LazyAe2](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/lazy-ae2) mod (the Mass-Assembler).

This is a javafx application where you can put in the width and the height of the block. I made it, so that the cobe is a square.
